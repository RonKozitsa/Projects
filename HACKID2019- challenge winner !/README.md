HackIDC challenge winner ! 

App overview - The app's goal is to help small businesses, we decided to focus on marketing and analysis of reviews.
The app will be a center place where the business owner could upload his business information and then it would spread  
all over of his relevant social media platforms, without any need to go one by one and do it manually, and therefore his bussiness information would be consistent and synchronized on all of the different platforms.
Furthermore, the app would be able to pull comments from the different platforms and analyze them, this proccess will include:
1. Categorizing bad comments and good comments and visualizing it for the business owner , showing him how is doing with time and what clients think of his bussines.
2. Recognizing issues and offering solutions, meaning, if 10 costumers complained about dirty toilets today, a notification would be sent to the business owner with an offer for a reccomended cleaning service (including special discount for using the app's service)

* Note - The code was written in 30 hours of consistent work (without sleep) and therefore is not written with any overview of beauty nor performance
