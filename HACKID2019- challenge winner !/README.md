HackIDC challenge winner ! 

App overview - The app's goal is to help small businesses, we decided to focus on marketing and analysis of reviews.
The app will be a center place where the business owner could upload his business information and then the app would spread it 
on all of his relevant social media account, without any need to go one by one and do it manually.
Furthermore, the app would be able to pull comments from the accounts and analyze them, this proccess will include:
1. Categorizing bad comments and good comments and visualizing it for the business owner , showing him how is doing with time and what clients
think of his bussines.
2. Recognizing issues and offering solutions, meaning, if 10 costumers complained about dirty toilets today, a notification would be sent to 
the business owner with an offer for a reccomended cleaning service (including special discount for using the app's service)

* Note - The code was written in 30 hours of consistent work (without sleep) and therefore is not written with any overview of beauty nor performance
