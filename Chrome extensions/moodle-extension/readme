As a student, when loging into the Reichman University site, they had an annoying issue that showed an error message and this could only be fixed 
by clearing cookies and local storage and refreshing the page.
For me, as a developer, it is simple to fix, but for people with no technical knowledge, it is more complex to do, so I developed this extension that does
it with a click of a button.
