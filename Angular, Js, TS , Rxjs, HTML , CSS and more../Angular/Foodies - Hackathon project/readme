Hackathon at work- foodies app
Let employees comunicate what they order for lunch, so they can order together and avoid delivery costs for low cost orders, or find people to eat with.
Lets say you want to eat chinese food for lunch, mark it on foodeis and see if anyone else wants to order with you or maybe go eat out with you in the restaurant.
