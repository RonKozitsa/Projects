Developed a website for my wife's paintings, the website is very simple, I made it also to practice newly learned skills of AWS.
The website is deployed on Amazon AWS:
- Ststic website is stored on S3 bucket
- Routing and DNS resolvig is done by Amazon Route53
- Cloudfront is used to serve content from closest point to the user
- Secure https connection using AWS certificate service (not needed on this site, but nice to have)
- Complete CI/CD with AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline
